The utilization of Multilingual T5-translation, summarization, and language classification can aid
in the creation of MCQs and fill-in-the-blanks from regional language text paragraphs. This
involves natural language processing algorithms to identify key concepts and generate relevant
questions. This can benefit individuals who are not proficient in the regional language, as it
improves their language skills and understanding of the content. Additionally, educators and
researchers can use this method to evaluate the comprehension and retention of their students
or participants. This can be especially helpful for small-scale tuition educators to create
assessments.
